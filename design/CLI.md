# CLI

lsfr is a CLI tool for learning to build complex systems from scratch. Take on challenges like distributed databases, message queues, load balancers, or even LLMs by implementing them step-by-step through progressive tests.

## Philosophy

**Succeed quietly; fail fast & loudly.** When tests pass, show brief confirmation and celebrate milestones. When things break, provide detailed diagnostics and actionable next steps.

**No surprises.** Every command does exactly what it says with no surprises or hidden side effects. Current state is visible in `lsfr.yaml`, not hidden internally.

**Make the common case effortless.** The most frequent workflow gets the shortest commands with minimal or no flags. Tracked state in `lsfr.yaml` supports this.

**Progressive disclosure of complexity.** Each stage builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts only when foundations are solid.

## Starting Challenges

`lsfr new <challenge> [<path>]`

```bash
# Basic usage (defaults to current directory)
$ lsfr new key-value-store
Created challenge in current directory
  run.sh       - Your implementation entry point
  README.md    - Challenge overview and requirements
  lsfr.yaml    - Tracks your progress

Implement http-api stage, then run 'lsfr test'.

# Specify custom path
$ lsfr new key-value-store my-kv-store
Created challenge in directory: ./my-kv-store
  run.sh       - Your implementation entry point
  README.md    - Challenge overview and requirements
  lsfr.yaml    - Tracks your progress

cd my-kv-store and implement http-api stage, then run 'lsfr test'.

# State tracking & config
$ cat lsfr.yaml
challenge: key-value-store
stages:
  current: http-api
  completed:

# Runner script
$ cat run.sh
#!/bin/bash

# This script runs your implementation
# lsfr will execute this script to start your program
# "$@" passes any command-line arguments from lsfr to your program

echo "Replace this line with the command that runs your implementation"
# Examples:
#   go run ./cmd/server "$@"
#   python main.py "$@"
#   ./my-program "$@"

$ cat README.md
# Key-Value Store Challenge

Build a distributed key-value database from scratch. You'll start with a simple HTTP API and progressively add persistence, clustering, and fault tolerance.

## Stages

1. **http-api** - Basic GET/PUT/DELETE operations
2. **persistence** - Data survives restarts and crashes
3. **clustering** - Multi-node replication
4. **fault-tolerance** - Handle network partitions

## Getting Started

1. Edit _run.sh_ to start your implementation
2. Run _lsfr test_ to test the current stage
3. Run _lsfr next_ when ready to advance

Your server should listen on port 8888 and implement:
1. PUT /kv/{key} - Store a value
2. GET /kv/{key} - Retrieve a value
3. DELETE /kv/{key} - Delete a value

Good luck! ðŸš€
```

## Testing Stages

`lsfr test [<stage>]`

```bash
# Test current stage (reads from lsfr.yaml)
$ lsfr test
Running http-api: Basic Operations

âœ“ PUT operations
âœ“ GET operations
âœ“ DELETE operations
âœ“ Error handling

PASSED âœ“

Your key-value store can now handle basic operations.

Run 'lsfr next' to advance to persistence.

# Test specific stage
$ lsfr test persistence
Running persistence: Data Persistence

âœ“ Data survives restart
âœ“ Handles crash recovery
âœ“ Maintains API compatibility

PASSED âœ“

Your data now persists across restarts.

Run 'lsfr next' to advance to clustering.

# When tests fail, show detailed info automatically
$ lsfr test http-api
Running http-api: Basic Operations

âœ“ PUT operations
âœ“ GET operations
âœ— Error handling

PUT http://127.0.0.1:8888/kv/ "foo"
  Expected response: "key cannot be empty"
  Actual response: ""

  Your server accepted an empty key when it should reject it.
  Add validation to return 400 Bad Request for empty keys.

FAILED âœ—

# Stage that doesn't exist
$ lsfr test unknown
Stage 'unknown' does not exist for key-value-store.

Available stages:
  http-api
  persistence
  clustering
  fault-tolerance
```

## Progression

`lsfr next`

```bash
# Advance to next stage
$ lsfr next
Advanced to persistence: Data Persistence

Your implementation must now:
- Persist data across restarts
- Handle crash recovery
- Maintain the same HTTP API

Run 'lsfr test' when ready

# Update state/config file
$ cat lsfr.yaml
challenge: key-value-store
stages:
  current: persistence
  completed:
    - http-api

# Try to advance without passing current stage
$ lsfr next
Complete http-api before advancing.

Run 'lsfr test' to see what's failing.

# Already at final stage
$ lsfr next
You've completed all stages for key-value-store! ðŸŽ‰

Share your work: tag your repo with 'lsfr-go' (or your language).

Consider trying another challenge @ lsfr.io/challenges
```

## Information Commands

`lsfr list`

```bash
# List available challenges
$ lsfr list
Available challenges:

  key-value-store    - Distributed key-value store (4 stages)
  message-queue      - Distributed message queue (3 stages)
  load-balancer      - HTTP Load balancer (3 stages)

Start with: lsfr new <challenge-name>
```

`lsfr status`

```bash
# Show current progress and challenge info
$ lsfr status
Challenge: key-value-store - Distributed Key-Value Store
Current stage: persistence (2/4 stages)

Learn distributed systems by building a key-value database from scratch.
You'll implement replication, consensus, and fault tolerance.

Progress:
âœ“ http-api          - HTTP API with GET/PUT/DELETE
â†’ persistence       - Survive restarts and crashes
  clustering        - Replication and eventual consistency
  fault-tolerance   - Handle network partitions

Implement persistence, then run 'lsfr test'.
```
