# lsfr

_Build complex systems from scratch._

Progressive challenges to learn distributed systems and other complex systems by implementing them yourself.

## Quick Start

Install:

```bash
go install github.com/st3v3nmw/lsfr/cmd/lsfr@latest
```

See [lsfr.io](https://lsfr.io/guides/cli/#installation) for other installation methods.

Start a challenge:

```bash
lsfr new kv-store
lsfr test
```

## How it Works

Write code, run tests, get detailed feedback. Progress through stages as you build real systems.

When you complete a challenge, consider tagging your repo with `lsfr-<language>` (e.g., `lsfr-go`, `lsfr-rust`) to share your implementation.
