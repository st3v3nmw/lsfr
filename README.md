# lsfr

_Build distributed systems from scratch._

Progressive challenges to learn distributed systems and other complex systems by implementing them yourself.

## Quick Start

Install:

```console
$ go install github.com/st3v3nmw/lsfr/cmd/lsfr@latest
```

Or with Homebrew:

```console
$ brew tap st3v3nmw/tap
$ brew install st3v3nmw/tap/lsfr
```

See [lsfr.io](https://lsfr.io/guides/cli/#installation) for version pinning and other installation methods.

Start a challenge:

```console
$ lsfr list             # List available challenges
$ lsfr init kv-store    # Create challenge in current directory
$ lsfr test             # Test your implementation
$ lsfr next             # Advance to the next stage
```

## How it Works

Write code, run tests, get detailed feedback. Progress through stages as you build real systems.

If you're on GitHub, consider adding `lsfr` and `lsfr-<language>` (e.g., `lsfr-go`, `lsfr-rust`) as topics to your repository to share your implementation.
